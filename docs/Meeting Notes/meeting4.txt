1. image storage
images will be stored in a /res/ directory and obtained through the filename when needed
a django ImageField will be used to store this in the database. 
Adam to research how this works (as he is responsible for the card collection view)

2. any issues?
Adam - was previously waiting on Card image implementation to be decided
Thinks he should be able to work now.
